## Comments or notes about problems 

> When I tried to convert the md file to a pdf in terminal (GitBash/ Pandoc) it did not worked for me. Maybe in windows computers there is a different command?
  Also, I created the file titled "pandoc_transformations.zip." However, when I uploaded these files into my repository, it displayed as three different files. Not sure     what I did wrong. Maybe, we can go over on Thursday.
